# WP2MD - Wordpress to markdown

A script to convert wordpress HTML to markdown. I use this to convert my posts and pages to markdown for cross-posting to other websites.

Customize it to your needs in order to process custom HTML from your specific wordpress installation (plugins, custom HTML and CSS).

DISCLAIMER: I am terrible at python programming.

## Dependencies
